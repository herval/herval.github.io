# Startups/companies/what-have-you

I started lots of stuff. Some of it worked, some of it didn't. I'm not done yet!

## [DailyCrunch](https://betalist.com/startups/thedailycrunch)
Automatically sync your Pocket and Instapaper articles as daily magazines for the Kindle. Apparently not a lot of people read non-books on their Kindles, so I finally shut this down in 2017.

## [Novelo](http://novelo.com)
A Facebook commerce platform. Startup Chile Alumni (1st batch), shut down in 2012.

## [BlooBox](http://bloobox.com.br)
A Wordpress-like platform for Digital Signage. Acquired in 2011.

## [InvestidorVirtual](http://investidorvirtual.com)
A stock market simulation game that reached 25,000 very active users (deactivated in 2009 due to "regulatory costs" aka Bovespa didn't like the competition).

## [MyGuestmap](http://mapservices.org/myguestmap)
A mapping service that allows users to set up their own Google Maps-based guestbooks and embed the maps on their own websites, reaching 45,000+ regular users. Deactivated in 2015 due to payments and API issues.

## [Sollipsis Interactive](http://sollipsis.com)
Selling mobile games. In Brazil. In 2003. Perfect timing!

## [Connect](http://cnnt.com.br)
My first company (founded 2001). Focused on PalmOS software and sales force automation. Company still lives on!
